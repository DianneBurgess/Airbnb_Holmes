# **Watch Out: Airbnb Prices in Amsterdam Rapidly Increase**
### *To what extent does the neighbourhood popularity influence the prices of listings in Amsterdam?*

### **Research Motivation**
Airbnb is one of the largest platforms for sharing accomodations worldwide and is operating in 100,000 cities and towns around the world (Airbnb, 2021). Admiak (2018) found that most of the listings in European cities, are centered around major tourist cities. Airbnbs in these cities are evidently located and spread over different neighborhoods. According to Can (1992), the price of a listing will be determined based on two characteristics: the physical characteristics, such as number of bath and bedrooms, and by variables related to the neighborhood. Neighborhoods thus play a significant role in determining the price of a listing. In many cities, there are up-and-coming neighborhoods. Airbnb hosts who are aware that a particular neighborhood is becoming more popular, could obviously benefit from this change in popularity. A price increase of a few euros will most likely not be noticed by people who book an Airbnb. The question which arises from this is therefore whether the popularity of neighborhoods affects the price of listings. This research is conducted over the city Amsterdam, and could in the future also be conducted over other cities. 


### **Research Method**
The chosen method for this research question is a regression. Time and price are compared to eachother for different AirBnbs in different neighborhoods in Amsterdam. 
First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.
Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

### **Running Instructions**
This repository contains a pipeline to download, explore, prepare and finally, analyze the data. Therefore, a first step that needs to be made is to link the data (cloning) to your laptop or desktop. To do this, make needs to be installed. For installation instructions on make for Mac and Windows users, you can click [here](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/automation-and-workflows/make/). If make is downloaded, open the Command Prompt for Windows users or Terminal for Mac users, which can be downloaded through Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Thereafter, move the folder... explain here how to move the workflow and where to find it on the computer.
