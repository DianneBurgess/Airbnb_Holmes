The Influence of Neighborhood Popularity on the Prices

#### **Research Motivation**
Airbnb is one of the largest platforms for sharing accomodations worldwide and is operating in 100,000 cities and towns around the world (Airbnb, 2021). Admiak (2018) found that most of the listings in European cities, are centered around major tourist cities. Airbnbs in these cities are evidently located in different neighborhoods.  
This project focusses on whether the popularity of neighborhoods affects the price for a booking.

#### **Research Method**
First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.
Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

#### **Repository Overview**
Provide an overview of the directory structure and files, for example:

├── README.md
├── data
├── gen
│   ├── analysis
│   ├── data-preparation
│   └── paper
└── src
    ├── analysis
    ├── data-preparation
    └── paper

#### **Running Instructions**
Explain to potential users how to run/replicate your workflow. If necessary, touch upon the required input data, which secret credentials are required (and how to obtain them), which software tools are needed to run the workflow (including links to the installation instructions), and how to run the workflow.
