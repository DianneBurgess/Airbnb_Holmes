# <span style="color:red">**Watch out: Airbnb prices in Amsterdam rapidly increase**</span>
*To what extent does the neighbourhood influence the prices in Amsterdam?*

### **Research Motivation**
Airbnb is one of the largest platforms for sharing accomodations worldwide and is operating in 100,000 cities and towns around the world (Airbnb, 2021). Admiak (2018) found that most of the listings in European cities, are centered around major tourist cities. Airbnbs in these cities are evidently located and spread over different neighborhoods. According to Can (1992), the price of a listing will be determined based on two characteristics: the physical characteristics, such as number of bath and bedrooms, and by variables related to the neighborhood. Neighborhoods thus play a significant role in determining the price of a listing. In many cities, there are up-and-coming neighborhoods. Airbnb hosts who are aware that a particular neighborhood is becoming more popular, could obviously benefit from this change in popularity. 
This project focusses on whether the popularity of neighborhoods affects the price for a booking and is conducted over the city Amsterdam.

### **Research Method**
First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.
Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

### **Repository Overview**
Provide an overview of the directory structure and files, for example:

├── README.md
├── data
├── gen
│   ├── analysis
│   ├── data-preparation
│   └── paper
└── src
    ├── analysis
    ├── data-preparation
    └── paper

### **Running Instructions**
Explain to potential users how to run/replicate your workflow. If necessary, touch upon the required input data, which secret credentials are required (and how to obtain them), which software tools are needed to run the workflow (including links to the installation instructions), and how to run the workflow.

This repository contains a pipeline to download, explore, prepare and finally, analyze the data. Therefore, a first step that needs to be made is to link the data (cloning) to your laptop or desktop. To do this, make needs to be installed. For installation instructions on make for Mac and Windows users, you can click [here](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/automation-and-workflows/make/). If make is downloaded, open the Command Prompt for Windows users or Terminal for Mac users, which can be downloaded through Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Thereafter, move the folder...
